# Endless
DoomClone/BuildEnigne like game made with Unity
This project is a long time side project where there will be added episodes and levels endlessly untill I feel tired of it.
It's now mainly to get an interesting to me intro into 3D gamedev. And after just a little hobby.
All art assets are planned to be mine. As well as music. So I will consider it to be sold on some platform. Depending on publishing costs.

There will be a demo with first episode or two on itch.io for free though.
